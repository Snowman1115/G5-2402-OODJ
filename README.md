1.0 COURSEWORK TITLE
Project Management System
2.0 THE COURSEWORK OVERVIEW
Academic Guidance Hub (AGH) is a leading academic institution involved in enhancing its academic projects more effectively. The current manual processes for student enrollment, project assignment, and evaluation have become cumbersome and has room for enhancements. To address these issues and enhance the overall project management workflow, AGH requires a robust software solution developed by a skilled software development team. Your team is given this offer to come out with an Object-Oriented System using JAVA that will automate right from student enrollment to project assignment and evaluation. The proposed Project Management System (PMS) will streamline every step of this process. PMS will have the flexibility to enroll in projects individually or through group intakes data file containing student details by the Project Managers.
Project Managers, are the key players of the proposed system, will create and assign projects across various categories, including internships, investigation reports, RMCP, Capstone project – P1, Capstone project – P2 and FYP reports. They will also have the authority to assign Lecturers as Supervisors and Second Markers for each assessment, ensuring proper oversight and evaluation of student projects.
Lecturers, acting as Supervisors and Second Markers, will utilize the system to view their assigned supervisees, set presentation dates, and evaluate the results of submitted reports.
Students can submit the details of the submitted project work like (Moodle link) etc. for evaluation, request presentation dates, and set confirmed presentation dates to notify supervisors and second markers assigned.
Admin plays most important functions which includes enrolling students as intake (from student list in a data file) or individual, create lecturers who can be either supervisor or second marker for a student, assign project manager role to specified lectures (Project Managers).
As a team of Object-Oriented Programmers, you need to identify the required classes, attributes, associations, and OOP concepts needed and implement the functionality required by your client AGH.
In addition, a supporting document is needed to reflect the design of the implementation codes and the implementation details that utilize the Object-oriented programming concepts.
3.0 OBJECTIVES OF THIS COURSEWORK
Develop the practical ability to describe, justify, and implement an Object-oriented system.
